Module code: JOM299  
City University  
2018-2019

---

In this repo you will find all the course material and presentations for the 2017-2018 Advanced Data and Coding Module for City University MA in Interactive Journalism.

## Module outline and aims

> Digital journalists increasingly need a complex skillset of developer knowledge, as well as a native understanding of application programming interfaces (APIs) and ‘scraping’ of online sources to be able to interrogate and investigate ‘big data’ in the public interest.

> This module, which follows on from ‘Introduction to Data Reporting aims to train you to work effectively a professional digital journalist. By the end of this module you will have an advanced knowledge of data journalism, including skills to investigate and interrogate ‘big data’; demonstrate developer skills in a range of coding languages; be able to interrogate application programme interfaces (APIs) and deploy scraping tools; critically evaluate data sets and complex investigations; and appreciate the accountability role of digital data reporting for civil society in advanced democracies.

from the module handbook

## What will i be expected to achieve?

Upon successful completion of this module, you will be expected to be able to:

####Knowledge and understanding:

* Demonstrate a critical understanding of the importance of digital data reporting as aform of accountability journalism in democratic society
* Display an understanding of the roles, priorities and workflows of journalists, developers, and programmers who work with and enable the publication of digital journalism

####Skills:

* Use judgment to analyse and evaluate suitable sources of data and datasets
* Develop suitable problem-solving approaches to address typical challenges in a digitalnewsroom
* Complexity in the use of skills using technologies application programme interfaces (APIs) and ‘scraping’
* Demonstrate developer skills in a range of coding languages

#### Values and attitudes:

* Display a comprehensive understanding of the ethical responsibilities of sourcing and publishing data
* Be self-directed in learing and skills-training, particular in coding
* Be cognisant of ongoing developments in current practice, scholarship and research of developer lead journalism

# Teaching plan

## Week 1 - The basics

We'll talk at length about the module itself and how it will be evaluated. We'll look at some online resources to look at every week to get a feel for what's going on in the field of interactive journalism.

We will also go through a general introduction to programming concepts - which are applicable regardless of the programming language you choose.


## Week 2 - A basic data visualisation of air pollution

We will work our way through a dataset of air pollution in London and produce a simple visualisation.

This will give us the chance to clean and tidy up a dataset (a prerequisite to much of the work we do) and enrich it with average calculations.


## Week 3 - Exploring the EU referendum data

We will explore the results of the EU referendum as we would on an election results day, producing incresingly interesting visualisations supporting news lines as we go along.

We will also learn to combine datasets together to create richer, original data based on our hypotheses.


## Week 4 - A simple map of LGBT rights in Europe

We will represent a dataset as a map of Europe and talk through geographical projections and colour theory to illustrate the state of LGBT rights on the continent.


## Week 5 - Complex maps of Pacific storms

We keep looking at representing geographical data through studying 20 year of storms in the Asia-Pacific basin. Once again, we'll model several visualisations based on hypotheses and news lines.


## Week 6 - Scraping Reddit and Twitter

We will dip our toes into scraping with the assistance of packages and module wrapping around these services' APIs. We will illustrate how clear questions and hypotheses can be illustrated quickly with familiar tools.


## Week 7 - Italian election poll of polls

We will work through more involved scraping and data cleaning to produce of a poll of polls including original rolling average calculations ahead of an election.


## Weeks 8, 9, 10 - Project work

We will go round the room and take questions about final project. Come prepared with actual problems, be happy to work collaboratively and to make progress in class while we tackle challenges collectively, on the big screen.
